# Example

I've created a little example that tests the todoMVC.

Just run `make test` in the example folder to test adding and deleting todo's. 

For other make commands run `make info`.

## Cant run make?

- Start app: `docker-compose up -d app`
- Run tests: `docker-compose run --rm puppeteer-cucumber`
